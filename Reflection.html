                To be honest, the toughest part of this project for me was my time management. I spent a lot of time switching between idea and watching tutorials that wasn’t useful and also leaving things till the last minute. While I was publishing my game with OpenGL on Unity community, I computer crashed and it was the ram, so all the things that was stored in the ram are all gone, including my files for the project, and I didn’t have time to redo everything. The performance of myself doing this project was way below my own expectations for myself. I feel like that I made a trash and wasted so much time. So if I have a chance to do the project again next time, I will faster choose what will I do for the project and also beclear to myself, what am I going to do? And actually find totrials that will target on what I am making.
